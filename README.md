### Hi! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Sparrrgh, a cybersecurity student at [Unimi](https://www.unimi.it/en).<br/>
Passionate about *web exploitation* and *reverse engineering*.<br/>
Most of my code is in **Python3**, but sometimes I use **Javascript** or **C#**.<br/>
I'm currently learning **Rust** to write low-level, parallel and fast tools. <br/>

### 2021 Roadmap ðŸ§­
Things I would like to do in 2021.
- Git gud at **binary exploitation**.
- Write a basic fuzzer in **Rust** *(Inspired by Gamozolabs' [Fuzzweek](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSkhUfcCXvqHsOy2VUxuoAf5m_7c8RqvO))*.
- Write some n-day exploits *(Inspired by Maddie Stone's [Reversing the Root](https://www.blackhat.com/us-20/briefings/schedule/#reversing-the-root-identifying-the-exploited-vulnerability-in--days-used-in-the-wild-20308) talk at BH20).
- Maybe actually finish my bachelor degree.
